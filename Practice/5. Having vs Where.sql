-- HAVING vs WHERE
-- HAVING only works after the group by where WHERE doesn't work?

SELECT gender, AVG(age)
FROM employee_demographics
GROUP BY gender
HAVING AVG(age) > 40
;

SELECT occupation, AVG(salary)
FROM employee_salary
WHERE occupation LIKE '%manager%'
GROUP BY occupation
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000
;
